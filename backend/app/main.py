"""FastAPI application entry point.

Wiring, lifespan, and health. Everything else lives in a feature slice.

Notable behaviours:

* ``Base.metadata.create_all`` runs at startup (kept from the base codebase) so
  ``docker compose up`` and a first Render boot work with zero manual steps.
  Alembic is the authority thereafter — see ``alembic/`` and the README.
* The follow-up scheduler starts as a background task and is cancelled on
  shutdown. It is also drivable over HTTP for an external cron, because Render's
  free tier spins the service down after 15 idle minutes.
* ``/health`` is the UptimeRobot target and reports the dependency status without
  ever raising, so a cold Neon compute reads as ``degraded`` rather than as an
  outage.

    the reasoning that local files are "dev only". That broke the feature outright
